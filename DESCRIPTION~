Description: Computes the pleiotropy-informed Bayesian conditional false
    discovery rate (cFDR) as described in Andreasson (2013) and Liley (2015)
    allowing for sharing of controls between GWAS. Also computes the associated
    false-discovery rate amongst SNPs for which cFDR is less than some cutoff.
