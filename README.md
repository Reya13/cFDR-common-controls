cFDR-common-controls
====================

This repository contains R functions to compute the 'Conditional False Discovery Rate', a method to analyse genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for related diseases originally proposed by Andreasson et al (2013), in the case where the two GWAS have shared controls.These functions widen the scope of the existing technique and enable improved power.
